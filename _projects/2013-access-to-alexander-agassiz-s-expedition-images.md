summary: "The Alexander Agassiz collection of about 1,000 gelatin dry plates, film negatives and prints dating from the late 1890s to the early- 20th century is important because it uniquely adds to Agassiz scholarship, providing access to many unpublished images from expeditions. Alexander Agassiz (1835-1910) was a pioneer in oceanographic research, zoological investigation, & mining engineering, devoting four decades to expanding & developing the Harvard University Museum of Comparative Zoology. He was best known as a naturalist & for his expeditions, conducting deep-sea investigations, & studying coral islands & reefs. The material is primarily glass negatives with some film negatives & print photographs that chronicle Agassiz's voyages on the Albatross, Challenger, Croydon, Yaralla and other ships between 1890 & 1909. There are also some domestic scenes from Agassiz's Rhode Island home. The collection includes images of expedition sites, primarily, but also some research materials."
