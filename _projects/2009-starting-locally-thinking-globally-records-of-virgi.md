F. Conger papers, 6 ft.), oil exploration and production (Edrington Oil Corp., 5 ft.), shoe and hosiery manufacture and sales (including efforts of company owners to offer equal pay for equal work regardless of race or gender well before required by law [Craddock-Terry Company and Lynchburg Hoisery Mills records, 94 ft.]), pharmaceuticals (Owens & Minor, 27 ft.), insurance (including efforts to influence national legislation regarding roads and travel safety [Travelers Protective Assoc., 15 ft.]), retail and marketing (assorted collections, 53 ft.), containers (Seward, 18 ft.), and paper manufacturing (Cauthorne Paper, 3 ft.)."
