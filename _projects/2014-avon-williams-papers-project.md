Tennessee, which impacted desegregation in Tennessee higher education; representation of Nashville 1960s civil rights activists; and other cases (many in collaboration with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and his first cousin, Thurgood Marshall, who went on to become the first African American associate justice on the U. S. Supreme Court)."
