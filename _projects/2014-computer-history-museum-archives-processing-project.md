summary: "The Computer History Museum (CHM) seeks funding to process and make publicly available 26 of its most significant yet hidden collections documenting the Information Age and its ongoing impact on society. The CHM Archives Processing Project (CHM APP) is a two year project that will employ a processing team of one Project Archivist and one Assistant Archivist, plus volunteers. The Museum will utilize More Product Less Process (MPLP) techniques to make the collections available as quickly and efficiently as possible. By the project's completion, 26 finding aids will be posted to the Museum's online catalog and to the Online Archive of California (OAC), and will be publicized via relevant professional newsletters and social media outlets."
