summary: "The collections contain documentation of curriculum preparation and teaching of our nationally recognized college's Native American studies (NAS) extending over the past 41 years, including: syllabi, lecture notes, research analyses, reports, interviews, meeting minutes, correspondence, histories, genealogies, images, publications, and audio-video presentations by faculty teaching in the NAS and related Master of Public Administration Tribal Governance program.
