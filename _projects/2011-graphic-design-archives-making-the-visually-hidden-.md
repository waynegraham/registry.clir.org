summary: "This project will make available to scholars the visually rich collections of eight graphic designers found within the Graphic Design Archives of the Cary Graphic Arts Collection at Rochester Institute of Technology Libraries. The Graphic Design Archives at RIT document and preserve the work of historically significant American graphic designers active from the 1920s to the 1950s. In addition, selected contemporary designers working in the modernist traditions are also included. The holdings of the Graphic Design Archives include over thirty designers; however because they are not processed, eight of those collections are virtually hidden from researchers. These eight archives include the following individuals -- Elaine Lustig Cohen, Rudolf de Harak, William Golden, Matthew Leibowitz, Cipe Pineles, Alex Steinweiss, Fred Troller, and George Tscherny. All of these collections are of interest to scholars in a broad range of disciplines, from graphic design historians to researchers studying the history of business and advertising to scholars studying the role of women in design and publishing to art and design museum curators."
