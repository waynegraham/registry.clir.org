summary: "A three-year processing project, to process collections of notable MIT physicists; all leaders and pioneers. The collections include research, teaching, writings, and professional and personal materials. They cover a broad range of topics and research areas and include: theoretical physicists, interdisciplinary approach to materials research; interpreters of science and technology: promoting broad public understanding, and advocating for science policy; mentors and leaders in their scientific disciplines; issues pertaining to women in science; and several connections to the Manhattan Project. These collections were selected because of their breadth, and because current access is hampered by the lack of processing and description."
