summary: "With 17 museums, nine performing arts venues, 19 beautiful gardens, and the world-famous San Diego Zoo, San Diego's Balboa Park contains an astonishing array of treasures, including 150,000 research volumes, 600,000 collections objects, 7 million specimens, 5.5 million photographs, 120 million historic documents, and 4,000 annual music and theatrical performances and films. In April 2015, the Balboa Park Online Collaborative (BPOC) launched the Balboa Park Virtual Library project, an initiative to digitize and make accessible the Park's esteemed research libraries. Phase Two of the project (2016-2017) will focus on digitizing the San Diego Museum of Man and San Diego Natural History Museum's book collections and archival materials, such as photographs, field notes, and historic maps. This initiative will provide scholars and students with unprecedented access to Balboa Park's extraordinary science, anthropology, and cultural studies resources, which are currently available only to a handful of museum staff and researchers."
