summary: "This two-year project will process and create a detailed finding aid for the papers of jazz saxophonist John Stubblefield, known for his avant-garde style, his association with musical greats Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Tito Puente, among others, and for his ability to \"blow [the saxophone] like a raging torrent.\" (Robert Palmer, \"Jazz: John Stubblefield,‚Äù  New York Times, April 8, 1980, p. C5.) Contained in eighty containers, this inaccessible collection includes correspondence, photographs, musical compositions, and record albums of this significant jazz musician."
