summary: "Most of the material in the collection focuses on Byzantine, medieval, and Russian objects—metalwork, ceramics, glyptics, jewelry, enamels, mosaics, and paintings, sculpture, and drawings. The correspondence comes from museum curators and directors, photographers, commercial galleries, and private collectors worldwide. Since the collection is not cataloged, a selection of four cases was processed in order to estimate the amount of material needed for preservation of the contents and the subject and sources were recorded.
