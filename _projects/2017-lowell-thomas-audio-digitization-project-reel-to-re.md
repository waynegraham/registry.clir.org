summary: "The goal of the Lowell Thomas Audio Digitization Project is to digitize 174 reel to reel audiotapes in the Lowell Thomas Papers that have been identified as being at risk due to their advanced deterioration and historic significance. The digitization process will preserve the content of the audiotapes and make the content of the tapes more accessible to researchers. Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC) will act as the vendor for the project. Lowell Thomas was one of Americaâ€™s most popular news men from the 1930s through the 1970s. He delivered the news to millions of listeners every evening for forty-six years and became a household name. His news broadcasts document a significant range of 20th century history across the U.S. and the world. However, due to the obsolete format on which the recordings are housed, it is difficult for researchers to gain access to them."
