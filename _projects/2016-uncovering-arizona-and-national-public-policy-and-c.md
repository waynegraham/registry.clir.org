summary: "Conservative political philosophy and vocal advocacy in late 20th century Arizona precipitated nationally controversial legislation that paralleled or presaged debates and similar actions in other states. The period from 1985 to 1996 will be remembered as a transformative time in development of local and national public policies and programs for water resources management, border control and immigration, public and charter schools, tribal governance, cultural diversity, the arts, environmental protection, health care, civil rights, and voting rights. These issues precipitate actions and debates across America to this day. We will exemplify CLIR's core values and collaborative spirit, spark creative digital humanities research and community discussion, and reveal changes in Arizona and America over time. New production workflows will enable global open access to our previously hidden video archive of the award winning Arizona PBS (hereafter AZPBS) Arizona Horizon television programs."

material_description:  "For more than 30 years, viewers have relied on Arizona Horizon for in-depth coverage of issues of concern to Arizonans, and ASU Libraries has preserved these programs for AZPBS since 1989. Skilled hosts interview key community leaders, change makers, advocates and political leaders, or panelists engage in balanced discussions of critical, timely or controversial topics. Each thirty minute episode is presented in 2-3 segments concerning a specific topic, and some programs include background stories that prepare the audience for detailed discussions. Each Friday the \"Journalists Roundtable\" edition presents analysis of the week's events. Community interest is increasing: Horizon reached 3,500,665 viewers across all airs on all channels in 2015, up 15% over 2012. Notable recurring guests include Arizona governors Bruce Babbitt and Janet Napolitano, US Senators John McCain, Jon Kyl and Dennis DeConcini and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Appearances by national experts include journalist Walter Cronkite and Craig Barrett of Intel Corporation. Topics of national scholarly interest include groundwater management, the Colorado River and water supply, immigration, regional transportation, English language requirements, and Indian gaming."
