summary: "The Scarritt-Bennett Center's Virginia Laskey Research Library houses a significant archival collection concerning early women's missionary training; education of laity in the late 1800s' and early nineteen hundreds; and perspectives on the civil rights movement not documented before. That is why we believe the public should be more aware of it. With this project: finding aids, cataloging, indexing, and making it available by Internet will all be key in achieving a more publicly viewed collection."
