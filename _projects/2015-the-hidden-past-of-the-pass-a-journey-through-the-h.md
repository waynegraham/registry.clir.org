summary: "The Hidden Past of the Pass is a two-year project that will focus on the hidden history of the area known as \"the Pass\" , which includes El Paso, Texas; Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; west Texas; northern Mexico; and southern New Mexico. This project will digitize currently inaccessible historical photographs and historical archives of the El Paso Public Library (EPPL). The project will include historical photographs from EPPL's Aultman, Blumenthal and Calleros collections; the Trost and Trost architectural archives; maps; newspapers; cemetery records; and yearbooks. Metadata will be created for all digital images and the digital images will be cataloged, indexed and uploaded to EPPL's interactive, bilingual web portal. A variety of marketing and outreach strategies will be used to disseminate information about the digitized collections to scholars, academics, historians, genealogists, teachers, students and the general public."
