summary: "The Freedom Archives seeks a planning grant as a necessary first step in the preservation of in-depth exclusive recordings by Colin Edwards (1924-1994), an internationally known radio journalist and commentator. In 1949 he began as a combat correspondent with the British army in Malaya, Burma, Indochina, and Korea. Over the next 30 years he broadcast documentaries from around the world on a wide range of topics. We will conduct a careful classification process, analyze the physical condition, catalog, make database entries and compile a finder's aid for his large body of work. The Freedom Archives has the expertise and technical facility to provide a firm foundation for preservation and future access by scholars."
