summary: "This two-year project will focus on the arrangement and description of the Artpark Archive collection, resulting in the creation of a DACS-compliant intellectual finding aid accessible through the Burchfield Penney's custom-built content management system (CMS). Artpark, an outdoor venue in upstate New York, opened in 1974 to provide avant-garde artists and performers, teachers, students, and the public a space to create, celebrate and explore the arts. Through state-sponsorship, it offered residencies to national and internationally known artists through the mid-1980s. The collection currently totals about 180 boxes, in a range of materials, of which approximately 60% are thought to be unique to this collection."
