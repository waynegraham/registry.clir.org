summary: "Two significant collections within the Walter Havighurst Special Collections at the Miami University Libraries provide information about the early history of communities west of the Alleghenies. The collections of John H. James (1800-1881) and Samuel Fulton Covington (1819-1889) reflect those individuals’ involvement in local, state and national politics; trade and commerce; banking; and inland navigation. Both collections reflect these men’s commitment to and concerns for the growth and development of the nation in which they lived."
