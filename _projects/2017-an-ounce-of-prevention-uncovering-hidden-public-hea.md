summary: "Building on the strong collaborative partnerships and successes of the Medical Heritage Library (MHL), the Center for the History of Medicine (CHM) proposes to digitize 11,540 rare and historically rich pamphlets and print materials held by MHL partners that span the evolution of the field of public health from 1700 to 2000. These works, surfaced from thirty collections held by six of the largest history of medicine collections in the United States, cover health issues populations continue to grapple with today: communicable disease; health education; hygiene; food purity; nutrition; water sanitation; and the impact of alternative medicine on public health."
