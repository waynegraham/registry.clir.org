summary: "The materials to be processed document primarily the Western PA coal and coke industry. They include the records of firms such as the Ricks Company, which manufactured and marketed a conveyor feeding system used in the processing of coal for coke production; records of H.C. Frick and Company, which document properties, buildings, machinery, workers, and operations involved in coal mining, coke production, and steel production covering the H.C. Frick Company and U.S. Steel Corporation subsidiaries within Fayette County, PA; ; and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, Buffalo Rochester and Pittsburgh Division Records, which documents the railroad division's general management history. The Coal and Coke Heritage Photograph Collection documents the social history of several Fayette county communities--Uniontown, Connellsville, Brownsville--and other company towns dominated by the Frick Company and U.S. Steel; the Coal and Coke Heritage Oral History Collection contains ca. 1,000 interviews with coke and coke workers and area residents in the greater Fayette County region documenting life working for the coal and coke industry as well as life in the region; the Harold W.
