summary: "The Friends of the Maryland State Archives [MSA] proposes a detailed processing/documentary heritage project of the freedom papers in its collection. This project will fully process 111 manumission and certificate of freedom record series covering the period of 1774-1869 and publish the results online in the Guide to Government Records catalog [http://guide.mdsa.net/]. The MSA will digitize and place images of these record series online as the matching component. This project will be conducted by 3 full time professional archival staff members. Quarterly, each individual will completely process 9 collections, including digitization, and conduct a minimum of 1 public outreach activity based on the material they have processed to date."
