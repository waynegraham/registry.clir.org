summary: "The NCSU Libraries and the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) as its collaborating institution, propose a three-year project to digitize an estimated 239,000 pages of mixed archival materials from the Libraries’ nationally significant animal rights and animal welfare collections, and an estimated 150,000 pages from the ASPCA’s records documenting its history as a leader in national animal protection since its founding in 1866. These materials document diverse and multi-disciplinary components of animal advocacy discourse in the growing field of human-animal studies. This enormous shift in scholarly interest is widely referred to as the “animal turn.” Major activities to be carried out include the digitization and description of an estimated 389,000 archival pages for online access and discoverability; outreach and promotion; the development of a digitization workflow plugin for ArchivesSpace; and contributions to the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) support of scholarly annotations."
