summary: "SFAI's collections trace a cultural history that encompasses the San Francisco Bay Area and at the same time has significant international scope and impact. The collections amassed during SFAI's nearly 150-year history include audiotapes of public and classroom lectures, and catalogs, images, press, ephemera, and other documentation from decades of seminal exhibitions\"”all of which shed light on a broad swath of social and cultural history in the San Francisco Bay Area, and, by extension, the world. The collections that reflect this illustrious history comprise a rich resource for scholars in a range of disciplines, from art and art history to politics, literature, architecture, history, physics, geography, and many others. Locally, nationally and internationally, the researchers who consult the archives are students, academic scholars, curators, filmmakers, journalists, writers, and others. What they glean from their research becomes known to the world through lectures and college courses, books, films, exhibitions, and articles."
