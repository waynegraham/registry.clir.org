summary: "This 18 month project of the Redemptorists Denver Province entails the digitization of thousands of manuscripts and print items related to the history of their seminaries and communities. Materials consist of hand-written school and community annals and hand-made original school publications dating from the mid-19th to mid-20th century. Most of the items are bound and many are fragile, requiring a minimum amount of handling, so they will be scanned using a book scanner with book cradle. Metadata will be created simultaneously. The digitization and metadata production of these materials will enable scholars from multiple disciplines to access this unique collection in order to research the way in which religious orders lived, worked and studied at the height of religious fervor in the United States."
