summary: "The climate is changing rapidly. Archival data is essential to the study of climate change over time. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is responsible for managing, archiving, and disseminating cryospheric and polar data. Today, these data are digital. However, hidden within the NSIDC is a collection of historical expedition notebooks, photographs, manuscripts, maps, ice charts, glass plates, and films documenting the history of polar exploration, glacier photography, and climate change. We seek to create access to these collections and move them to the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries, an organization that has a mission to manage and facilitate use of these the types of collections."
