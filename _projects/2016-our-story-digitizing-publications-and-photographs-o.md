summary: "Our Story: Digitizing Publications and Photographs of the Historically Black Atlanta University Center Institutions is a thirty month collaborative project between the Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library, Spelman College Archives, Morehouse College, and the Digital Library of Georgia. Through digital reformatting, creation of metadata and a portal of publicly accessible collections on the AUC Woodruff Library's Digital Commons and the DLG, this project will broaden access to unique publications, periodicals, theses, dissertations and photographs documenting the history of the AUC - the largest consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Once completed, archives related to the following schools will be more easily discoverable throughout the world for scholarship about various aspects of African American higher education directly after emancipation of slavery through to the 21st Century: Atlanta University, Clark College, Clark Atlanta University, Gammon Theological Seminary, Interdenominational Theological Center, Morehouse College, Morris Brown College, and Spelman College."
