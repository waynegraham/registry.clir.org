summary: "The Buffalo Bill Center of the West's McCracken Research Library (MRL), in collaboration with Yellowstone National Park's Heritage & Research Center (HRC), will digitize and make freely available a vast collection of material from their respective repositories. The collections include maps, atlases, scientific papers, pamphlets, souvenirs, photographs, journals, and other rich ephemera from both Yellowstone National Park and the Shoshone National Forest. Established in 1891, Shoshone National Forest was the nation's first; it directly abuts Yellowstone, the world's first national park. This iconic region, and the perception people have of it, has served to fire imaginations all over the world. The three-year project will create open access to collections which will serve not only scholars and researchers in biology, geology, popular culture, and environmental and American history, but members of the general public, who remain enchanted by one of the last intact ecosystems in the lower forty-eight states."
