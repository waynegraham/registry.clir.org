Items included are from the: Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project (UMTRA); Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP); Human Radiation Experiments; Final Occurrence Reports; Sandia National Laboratories Technical Reports; and Sandia National Laboratories South West Environment Impact Statements (SWEIS). The collection is dynamic and materials are added on an ad-hoc basis. Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), a DOE funded laboratory, performs a wide variety of national security R&D energy and environmental technology research. The collection contains unclassified research materials generated by researchers and scientists at SNL and released for public review. The collection is dynamic and materials are added on an ad-hoc basis. The Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) safely disposes of the nation's defense-related transuranic radioactive waste. The collection consists of a variety of materials from the USEPA, NEPA, environmental monitoring, federal and New Mexico state regulations, transportation, the National Transuranic Waste (TRU) Program, nuclear safety and quality assurance and safety.
