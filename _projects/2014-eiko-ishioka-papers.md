summary: "The Eiko Ishioka collection at the Academy Foundation's Margaret Herrick Library comprises the film-related personal documentation and artistic output of production and costume designer Eiko Ishioka (1938-2012). This analog/born-digital collection is unprocessed and contains manuscripts, drawings, photographs, textiles, and costumes, along with a myriad of CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, floppy disks, and portable hard drives. After the 18 month grant period, the collection will provide a deeper understanding into the process of a maverick designer who consistently broke convention across artistic disciplines (BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, 1992; Cirque du Soleil Varekai, 2002; Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, 2008) and a case study in mixed-format processing."
