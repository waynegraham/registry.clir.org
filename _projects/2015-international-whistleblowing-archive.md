summary: "Our archiving plan involves contacting whistleblowers with the help of partnering organizations such as the Government Accountability Project and obtaining permission to archive their files. A lawyer will be retained to prepare contracts and review the donated documents. The Internet Archive service will convert the files to digital format for posting on our website by staff of the Internet Archive and volunteers. The information will then be available to people around the world, including many who lack the means to travel to a brick-and-mortar archive. We will also archive hundreds of articles and books collected by Don Soeken over a 35 year period."
