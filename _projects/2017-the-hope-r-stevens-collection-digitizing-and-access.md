material_description:  "The Hope R. Stevens Collection consists of approximately 25 cubic feet of correspondence, photographs, newspaper clippings, publications, and reports relating to his personal life, legal occupation and local, national, and international civic, as well as political activities from the 1930s to the 1980s. Stevens was a prolific lawyer in Harlem, starting in the late 1930’s until his death in the early 1980’s. Most noteworthy artifacts in this collection are Stevens’ award of the “Order of the British Empire” medal in its original case, a certificate along with the medal, and letters written to him congratulating him on his award. There are records and documents of Stevens’ private life, such as his will and testament, naturalization certificate, passports, personal correspondence to family and friends, his death certificate and memorial services. Other records and documents collected note Stevens’ professional work as a local Harlem lawyer and international lawyer, and his affiliations and activism with certain local and international organizations and projects. There is a collection of materials on the trail of Pol Pot, which Stevens took part in as an international lawyer, and these include legal reports, mission statement, and a speech given at the trail of Pol Pot. His affiliation with the Harlem Urban Development Corporation shows his involvement with the development of Harlem. Documents pertaining to other organizations in which he attended meetings and conferences, illustrate how prolific he was in different international organizations."
