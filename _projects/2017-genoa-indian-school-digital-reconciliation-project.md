summary: "The History Department, the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH), and University Archives & Special Collections at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) propose to collaborate with the Genoa U.S. Indian School Foundation and National Archives branches in Kansas City and Denver to digitize, describe, and make accessible materials related to the Genoa U.S. Indian Industrial School, one of the largest U.S. Indian boarding schools, which was in operation from 1884 to 1934. We will process approximately 10500 pages (or 3368 items) of student case files, admittance forms, correspondence, censuses, administrative and health reports, photographs, artwork, ephemera, artifacts, and a student newspaper held by the National Archives and by the Genoa U.S. Indian School Foundation. Our project will make these hidden records accessible to the families of Indian people who attended the school, researchers who study the Indian boarding schools, and the general public."

Prominent themes that emerge from the materials include American Indian health, disease, and medical treatment; childrenâ€™s labor and compensation; family communication and contact; resistance, discipline and punishment; sports and other extracurricular activities; federal government efforts to assimilate Native Americans; and government categorization of Indian people. Gathered together in one place, these materials will provide users with greater insight into the history of American Indians, education, Nebraska and the Great Plains, and the U.S. more generally."
