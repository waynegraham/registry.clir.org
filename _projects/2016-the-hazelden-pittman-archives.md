summary: "The digitization of the Hazelden Pittman Archives would allow for the continued preservation of this historic collection of alcoholism literature and artifacts located at Hazelden's main campus in Center City, MN, USA. The collection is focused on the topic of alcoholism, along with the related topics of drug addiction, prohibition, temperance, Alcoholics Anonymous, treatment, counseling, and gambling. Currently the archives are available by appointment and digitizing the collection would open up a tremendous amount of history to thousands if not millions of individuals working to impact and study in the field of addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery."
