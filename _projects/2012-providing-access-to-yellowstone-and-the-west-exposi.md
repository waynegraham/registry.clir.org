Northern Pacific Railroad: NPRR advertisements and Westward expansion propaganda; Photographs documenting engine technology and railway history; Railway resource and line maps; Early company records including ledgers, correspondence, payroll, accident reports, and temporary migratory laborers schedules; Local resident journals, scrapbooks and oral histories of railroad work. Union/Organizations: Union rosters, seniority lists, and meeting minutes for local railroad and mining unions, and women's auxiliaries; Organization scrapbooks with material documenting labor strikes; Lists of union-approved businesses and strike busters; Ephemera representing several pre-1900 unions; Records of community and civic organizations. Park County Community: Public records, papers and photos related to local laborers, builders and workers."
