summary: "This project aims to digitize a portion of the holdings of the Clatsop County Historical Society in Astoria, Oregon. Currently, the museum has these photographic collections: the Frank Woodfield collection (ca. 1902 – 1944); the Daily Astorian negatives (1973 – 1989); the Wilson Studio collection (ca. 1911 – 1939); the Ralph Horton collection (ca. 1909 – 1964); and the Reuben Jensen collection (ca. 1920 – 1940). The museum has all the rights to these collections, and while most of them are available to the general public, very little has been digitized, and thus require a researcher to view them in person. This project would make these available to anyone online."
