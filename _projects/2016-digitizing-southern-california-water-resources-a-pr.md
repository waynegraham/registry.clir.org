summary: "Over a 3-year period, the Claremont Colleges Library, A.K. Smiley Public Library, California State University Northridge Oviatt Library, California State University San Bernardino Water Resources Institute, National Archives and Records Administration at Riverside, Ontario City Library, and Upland Public Library will collaborate on digitizing materials that originated from a variety of sources such as federal, state, and local governments, water companies, local agencies, engineers, and other individuals involved in water development in the region from the 19th through the 20th centuries. This project targets more than 30 archival collections to be digitized, uploaded to an online digital asset management system, cataloged with descriptive metadata, and placed under a curation plan. The digitized collections will be accessible to all with internet access, provide a foundation for a \"distributed\" digital water resource archive, and facilitate and support digital scholarship for regional, national, and international researchers."
