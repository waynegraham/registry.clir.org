summary: "Stephen H. Schneider (1945-2010) was the Lane Professor for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies, Professor of Biology, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and a Senior Fellow in the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford. Internationally recognized for research, policy analysis and outreach in climate change, Schneider focused on climate change science, integrated assessment of ecological and economic impacts of human-induced climate change, and identifying viable climate policies and technological solutions. As one of the world's preeminent communicators of complex science, he consulted with eight US administrations and numerous national and international agencies. Dr. Schneider was actively involved with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an initiative of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Org. After decades of work, Dr. Schneider, along with four generations of IPCC authors, received a collective Nobel Peace Prize for their joint efforts in 2007. Professor Schneider's papers consist of Climatic Change editorial records; research files; teaching files; administrative records; correspondence; computer files/email; and audiovisual material. Well documented is the history, content, and implications of climate change science. It is a treasure trove for those interested in understanding and addressing climate change."
