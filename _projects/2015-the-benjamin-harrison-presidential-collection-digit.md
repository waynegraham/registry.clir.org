summary: "The IUPUI University Library Center for Digital Scholarship will collaborate with the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site to digitize the documents, photographs, and artifacts of America's 23rd president. President Harrison served our country from 1889-1893, a period preceding the establishment of national Presidential Libraries. The collection at the Presidential Site encompasses American history though the Harrison family from the Revolution to the Gilded Age. The Presidential Site is a private, independently funded nonprofit museum dedicated to preserving and sharing Harrison's presidential legacy and largely hidden collection of more than 10,000 historical items. We propose to digitize 6,425 items from the collection, opening access to the world and safeguarding this piece of United States history for the future. A combination of digital and 3D printing will create a uniquely dynamic historical archive."
