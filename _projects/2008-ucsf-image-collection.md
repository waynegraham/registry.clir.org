summary: "The University of California, San Francisco is among the oldest academic health centers in the western US, with origins in the earliest professional schools and hospitals in California. It is the only University of California campus devoted exclusively to the health sciences. UCSF faculty have conducted groundbreaking research in cancer, biotechnology, genetics, and infectious disease. The collection includes photographs, drawings, slides, and maps from the late 19th to the early 21st century illustrating: architecture of UCSF and pre-cursor institutions, showing the development of the Parnassus Heights campus and surrounding area, as well as downtown San Francisco; health care practitioners in UCSF hospitals, as well as other San Francisco hospitals, including St. Joseph’s, San Francisco General, Children’s Hospital; student life and social activities; campus organizations such as the Student Council and the Black Caucus; images from the 1960s and 1970s document social activism (e.g. civil rights and anti-war protests) among UCSF faculty, staff, and students. Images document the development of the health professions (medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy) in California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, and the western United States. Images illustrating UCSF leadership during larger event-- the 1906 earthquake, World War I and World War II, the AIDS epidemic, the emergence of biotechnology – give the collection significance as a source for social history."
