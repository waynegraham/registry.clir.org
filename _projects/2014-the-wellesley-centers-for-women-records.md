summary: "Processing the records of the Wellesley Centers for Women is a one-year project to catalog and create robust finding aids for an approximately 50 linear feet collection documenting the history and activities of one of the largest gender-focused research-and-action organizations in the world. There are also a number of born-digital files for the more current records, some of which are restricted by law, and electronic repositories currently used by Wellesley will be incorporated to manage those digital files."
