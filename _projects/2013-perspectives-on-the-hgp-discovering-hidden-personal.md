summary: "This project involves 27 personal collections, comprising some 185 lf of physical material and ~15GB of electronic material related to HGP. Among the individuals who created these collections are the developers of many methods/devices that were critical to the HGP; key leaders of the HGP; those instrumental in formulating genome policy and disseminating knowledge about the HGP; and specialists in the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The creators of the collections are life scientists: Norman G. Anderson, David Botstein, Patrick O. Brown, Charles Cantor, George Church, Helen Donis-Keller, Russell Doolittle, Dick McCombie, David L. Nelson, Harry Noller, Maynard Olson, Gerry Rubin, David C. Schwartz, Jim Sikela, Lloyd Smith, Ignacio Tinoco, and James Weber; computer scientists David Haussler and Jim Kent; and government administrators: Elbert Branscomb, Charles DeLisi, and Ari Patrinos; ELSI specialists: Reid Adler and Thomas Murray; and authors/journalists: Daniel Kevles and Nicholas Wade. The materials include: correspondence about the HGP, such as letters, memos, and emails; meeting materials, such as presentations, notes, and hand-outs; workshop materials, such as research materials, notes, and transcripts; scientific research materials, such as lab notebooks, raw data, and grant applications; public relations material, such as press releases and videos; and book materials, such as notes from interviews."
