summary: "This project would digitize the extensive collection of negatives created by Fred Bridenstine over a 50 year period starting in 1940 in Beaverhead County, Montana. He was a gifted amateur photographer as well as a dedicated outdoors-man with a fine collection of cameras. He was the official rodeo photographer for 30 years, retiring at age 75, saying: I had many close calls but was never hurt.\" He photographed all of the local athletic teams, the major buildings in the community both old and new, the mines in the county, many of the ranches and nearly every lake and stream that could be reached by foot or horseback."
