summary: "The goal of this 24-month project is to carry out cataloging of: (a) the archives of Yale paleontologists Richard Swann Lull, Charles Schuchert, and John Ostrom; (b) the artist Rudolph Zallinger; and (c) the archives of the Yale Peabody Museum's Education Department. Collectively, the materials will offer new insight on the role of paleontology as a vehicle for the public understanding of evolution that took place both within and beyond the Museum over the course of the 20th Century, encompassing three critical periods to our understanding of the natural world: the \"Eclipse of Darwinisim\"  the \"Neodarwinian Synthesis\"  and the \"Dinosaur Renaissance.â€ "
