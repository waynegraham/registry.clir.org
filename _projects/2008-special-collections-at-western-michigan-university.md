ICSC is the most significant collection of the Cistercian monastic tradition in North America and includes medieval manuscripts dating from 1174, printed books (incunabula to today), working papers and collections from prominent Cistercian monks and scholars of the order such as M. Basil Pennington and Jeremiah O'Sullivan. 2) WMU Medieval Studies collection, purchased to complement the loan, and working papers of medieval scholars outside of the order, such as the RHC Davis Manuscript collection."
