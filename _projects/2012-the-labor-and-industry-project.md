summary: "The Labor and Industry Project will result in a shared repository of finding aids for relevant collections from the Senator John Heinz History Center (HHC) (http://www.heinshistorycenter.org) and Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation (RoS) (http://riversofsteel.com). The finding aids will be housed on Historic Pittsburgh (http://digital.library.pitt.edu/pittsburgh/), a collaborative digital library site hosted by the University of Pittsburgh, and indexed by OCLC's ArchiveGrid. The collections document labor and industry in Western Pennsylvania from the 1850s, when business was booming, through the end of the 1990s, when a new era of innovation began. The formats of the materials consist of papers, photographs, glass slides, maps, films, and audio cassettes. The collections include: (1) HHC: George Westinghouse (1870s-2000), 120 linear feet of records related to the history of the company, including 1939 World's Fair, patents, research, correspondence, and photographs; Jones and Laughlin (J&L) Steel (1865-1984), 340 linear feet of records documenting the history of the company, which was a competitor of Carnegie Steel Company; and US Steel (1883-1980), 290 linear feet of records documenting the history Andrew Carnegie's company. (2) RoS: Duquesne National Works (1917-1970), 830 linear feet of records documenting financial and budgetary issues, correspondence, appropriations, requests, and technical materials relating to the mills."
