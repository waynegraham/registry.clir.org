summary: "The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute (BCRI) seeks support to send 36 original VHS interview recording tapes to a vendor for digitization and metadata creation in order to ensure the collection's use and availability to scholars and the general public for years to come. The collection includes recordings of interviews with persons who knew and worked with Oscar Adams, Jr., Alabama's first African American Supreme Court Justice and also the first African American elected to statewide constitutional office. Adams litigated many civil rights cases in his career as a lawyer and was part of the first African American law firm established in the state. Access to these oral histories will contribute to scholarship on Oscar Adams, the legal community in Alabama, and the role of African American lawyers in the 20th century movement for civil and human rights in the United States."
