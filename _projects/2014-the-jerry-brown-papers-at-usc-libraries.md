summary: "We will arrange and describe USC's Jerry Brown papers dating from 1970 to 1983. At present, no finding aid is available to help researchers explore this vast, complex, and historically significant collection. Our project will provide access to correspondence, records, and other papers--as well as photographs and audiovisual materialsâ€”documenting Brown's term as secretary of state (1971-1975) and first two terms as governor (1975-1983). Then as now, California was a bellwether state, and Gov. Brown's decisions on issues ranging from environmental issues to gender equality and taxation had national repercussions. They anticipate many key debates in contemporary U.S. politics."
