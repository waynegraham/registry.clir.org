summary: "We plan to make available four collections related to the Holocaust and Jewish and radical resistance to persecution before, during, and after World War II: 1. Helmut Hirsch Collection: The personal papers of Helmut Hirsch (1916-1937), a young German Jew executed by the Nazis for his involvement in a plot to bomb the Nazi headquarters at Nuremberg. Included are correspondence, photo albums, memorabilia, trial documents, and Hirschâ€™s poetry, artwork, travel diaries, school reports, and musical compositions. 2. Jewish Resistance Collection: A range of materials including: underground publications by German Communist and French Jewish resisters to the Nazi regime before and during WWII; international post-war reports and periodicals documenting the persecution and extermination of Jews and the course of several Nuremberg trials; and Nazi paraphernalia. 3. Lipman Nazi Documents: A range of original documents and correspondence by high-level Nazi officials including: the family papers of Wilhelm Frick, Reich Minister of the Interior; documents related to the assassination attempt against Hitler (1944); and original documents issued by top Nazi officials such as Goebbels, Goering, Hess, Himmler, Hitler, and von Ribbentrop. 4. Theresienstadt Concentration Camp Documents: Daily orders issued from the Theresienstadt Concentration Camp (1942-1944). The orders provide detailed information about the workings of the camp including the names and numbers of inmates killed on given dates."
