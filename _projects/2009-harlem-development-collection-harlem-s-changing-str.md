Documentary photographs provide a tangible visual reference to the structural changes and include representation of architectural structures such as residential and commercial buildings, historic landmarks, vacant lots and construction sites that document the evolution of Harlem’s redevelopment. Architectural drawings illustrate the vision of the architect and the design process. The collection contains building plans and includes both preliminary and presentation drawings and renderings.
