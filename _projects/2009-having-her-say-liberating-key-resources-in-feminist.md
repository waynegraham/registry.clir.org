summary: "The Records of MS. MAGAZINE (372 ft, circa 1970-95), the first commercial magazine with an unambiguously feminist perspective. Materials include office, editorial, publicity, promotion, circulation, and advertising files; article manuscripts; files on special projects and individual editors' correspondence and other professional papers. Records of WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LIBERATION (5 ft, 1968-83). Produced by a Baltimore collective as a forum for opinions and expression vital to the growing women's liberation movement, the materials include correspondence, minutes, research materials, and reader responses. Papers of Letty Cottin Pogrebin (b. 1939), a founder of MS. MAGAZINE, freelance writer, and popular lecturer on non-sexist childrearing, family life, feminism and Judaism. Her papers (91 ft, 1968-2008) include correspondence; research, organization, and subject files; drafts, published writings, and speeches. Papers of Dolores Alexander (1931-2008) freelance writer, reporter, and first executive director of the National Organization for Women (NOW). The 25 feet of papers (1945-98) document her writing career, activism, and broader feminist and lesbian issues. Photographer Cary Herz (1947-2008) began documenting the 1970s women's movement in NY City for MS. MAGAZINE as well as other publications. Her papers (20 ft, 1971-2007) include photographic prints, slides, and contact sheets documenting events of political, social and economic significance in the U.S."
