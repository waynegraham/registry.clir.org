summary: "The materials included in this project describe and document Alabama’s cultural, political and legal history from the territorial era to early twentieth century, as noted in the collections of William H. Brantley, Jr., Joseph Willett, Jr., Joseph Willett, Sr., and James E. Horton. While these collections focus on people and events important to Alabama history, they also provide insight into the history of the southeast region, as well as the United States as a whole."
