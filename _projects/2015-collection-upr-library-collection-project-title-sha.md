summary: "The purpose of the project is to digitize the University of Philosophical Research's Library's rare, out of print, and collectible books, manuscripts, periodicals devoted to art, astrology, comparative religion, ancient through modern philosophy, including many rare original editions from the 15th to the 18th centuries. The focus of this digitization effort is to digitize the rare and out of print books, and to make them accessible to our accredited university, students, scholars, in the U.S.and abroad, and the general public. The digitization of the library and rendering it accessible from anywhere in the world, would be a contribution to the dissemination of the knowledge and wisdom therein, but also to the exchange and growth of dialogue, cross cultural and cross discipline learning."
