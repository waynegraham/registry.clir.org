summary: "The Leather Archives & Museum (LA&M), a library, museum and archives pertaining to leather, fetishism, sadomasochism, and alternative sexual practices is seeking $78,320 to fund the digitization of two collections, publication of online finding aids, and creation of associated metadata for the personal archival collections of Jim Kane and Michele Buchanan. The project is estimated to last 1 year and 7 months. The historically evolving significance and scholarship of sexuality collections has lead the LA&M to choose Buchanan and Kane's collections for this grant cycle. These collections showcase two prominent, innovative, and active members of the leather community whose contributions to articulating and enacting leather identity and practice helped shape and continues to inspire modern leather communities."
