material_description:  "The New Museum’s Photography Collection contains photographic documentation of the Museum’s early staff, exhibitions and artworks, public programs, performances, and other events dating from its founding in 1977. Of particular note are previously unseen photographs documenting early performances and cross-disciplinary occurrences that took place as part of these exhibitions or as stand-alone events. The Audiovisual Collection contains moving image and sound recordings on obsolescent analog formats. Key among these materials to be digitized are recordings dating back to the Museum’s earliest public programs, including interviews with artists and curators, and exhibitions documentation. These recordings provide rare insight into programs--and participating artists--that challenged many prevalent currencies in the art world, and that addressed controversial topics ranging from the under-representation of women and minorities in the arts to AIDS activism. This collection includes numerous materials that are frequently requested for research. Due to their fragility and often the recording format, we are unable to share and/or release these materials publicly. With digitization, these materials will be ingested into our free online digital archive and available to all. All collections materials were created by the New Museum over the course of its programming. Notable subjects include: director Marcia Tucker; curators and critics William Olander, Laura Trippi, Thelma Golden, Dan Cameron, Hilton Als, and Hans Olrich Obrist; artists Carolee Schneemann, Adrian Piper, David Wojnarowicz, Marina Abramovic, Thornton Dial, Martha Rossler, Kara Walker, Lynda Benglis, Eric Fischl, Cory Arcangel, Elizabeth Peyton, and John Waters."
