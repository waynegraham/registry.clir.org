summary: "Over a 3-year period, the Claremont Colleges Library, A.K. Smiley Public Library, California State University Northridge Oviatt Library, California State University San Bernardino Water Resources Institute, National Archives and Records Administration at Riverside, Ontario City Library, and Upland Public Library will digitize materials that originated from a variety of sources such as federal, state and local governments, water companies, local agencies, engineers and other individuals involved in water development in the region from the 19th through the 20th centuries. This project targets more than 60 archival collections to be digitized, uploaded to an online digital asset management system, and cataloged with descriptive metadata. The digitized collections will be accessible to all with internet access, provide a foundation for a Southern California \"distributed\" digital water resource archive, and promote water resource research via digital exhibits."
