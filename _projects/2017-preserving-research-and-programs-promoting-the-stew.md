summary: "The material for this project includes 251 video and audio recordings comprised of historic documentation and research of an endangered population of orcas, interviews and explanations by original researchers, and documentation of programs implemented by the museum to promote the stewardship of whales. The recordings are at risk because of their format and storage environment. Their contents are valuable to regional, national and international researchers and educators, community members, and to efforts to conserve and protect our oceans."
