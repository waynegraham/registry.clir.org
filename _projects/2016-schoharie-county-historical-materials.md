summary: "This project will digitize materials relating to the history of Schoharie County and its residents, from its Native American settlements to the current rural and small town populations. Materials on Native American history in the area are held by the Iroquois Indian Museum; those relating to the European colonization and early to modern American residents are held by the Schoharie County Historical Society; and those relating to the history of local post-secondary education (primarily agricultural) are held by SUNY Cobleskill. The materials will be digitally scanned, described, and uploaded into DSpace for wide access. Together the collections provide a broad history of human life and culture in the area for more than 800 years."
