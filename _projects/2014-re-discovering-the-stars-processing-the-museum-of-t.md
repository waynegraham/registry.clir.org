summary: "The Museum of the City of New York will organize and describe its Collection on theatrical personalities, which includes correspondence, photographs, ephemera, annotated scripts, notes, contracts, scrapbooks, and memorabilia related to persons who worked professionally on and around the New York stage, including actors, playwrights, directors, critics, stage managers, lyricists, composers, and producers. The collection was assembled by Museum curators and staff over several decades, but it has never been comprehensively cataloged. This two-year project will result in an online finding aid and object-level cataloging of 1,000 collection highlights."
