summary: "The University of Houston Libraries proposes a 6-month project to outsource the digitization of 118 16mm films from the KUHT Collection. KUHT-TV began broadcasting from the University of Houston in 1953 under one of the countryâ€™s first educational non-profit licenses airing both for-credit \"telecourses\" and enriching programs aimed at a general audience. The films proposed for digitization represent some KUHT's earliest productions and are fledgling examples educational and public television."
