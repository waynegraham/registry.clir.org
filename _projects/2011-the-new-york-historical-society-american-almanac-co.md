summary: "The New-York Historical Society has a collection of approximately 5,500 eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth-century American almanacs, including an estimated 600 almanacs dating from before the year 1801. The collection is strongest in almanacs published in New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire, but it also includes representative examples from other states east and west of the Mississippi. Highlights include the only known copies of early eighteenth-century editions of Daniel Leedsâ€™s American Almanack, printed in New York by William Bradford; the earliest almanac printed in New Jersey, Poor Roger, 1760; and Confederate almanacs printed in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama, and Charleston, South Carolina."
