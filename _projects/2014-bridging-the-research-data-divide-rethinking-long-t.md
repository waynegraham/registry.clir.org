summary: "The collaborating libraries will create rich metadata for discovery, access, citation, and long-term preservation of maternal, infant, child, and youth health (MCH) research data. Work will focus on 1) historical paper and electronic research data for longitudinal studies, 1930-2010 (CLM), and 2) contemporary electronic research data for Canadian cohort and clinical trials from the Maternal, Infant, Child, Youth Research Network (UAL). This project will bring temporal depth in laying the groundwork for value-added long-term access to and preservation of the collections, while protecting the privacy of historical and current research participants and communities of study."
