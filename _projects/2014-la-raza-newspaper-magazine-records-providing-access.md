summary: "This three-year project will catalog a collection of 24,698 photographic negatives documenting the Mexican-descent community of Los Angeles between 1967 and 1977. These long inaccessible negatives were recovered in 2013, and represent an unprecedented decade-long photographic project involving eighteen photographers associated with La Raza. The bilingual publication-a tabloid newspaper from 1967-1970 and a magazine from 1970-1977-developed in the context of community-based journalism that sought broad documentation of events, achievements, and issues reflecting readers' lives. Since La Raza could only print a small portion of photographs, this collection constitutes a rare and broad visual record of the community during this period."
