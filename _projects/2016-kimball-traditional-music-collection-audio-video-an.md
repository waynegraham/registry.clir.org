summary: "This one-year project will accomplish the digitization, long-term preservation and dissemination of the James W. Kimball Traditional Music Collection. The materials document traditional New York State musicians in field and commercial recordings of interviews and performances, as well as extensive supporting information in print, photographic, manuscript and published media. The collection provides a unique opportunity for scholars of American Traditional Music with an emphasis on rural New York State. We will target audio and audiovisual recordings with the greatest risk of data degradation or loss. We will proceed to digitize print and ephemera with direct relationships to the recordings. This project is part of a larger initiative by SUNY Geneseo, the Genesee Valley Council on the Arts (GVCA) and community stakeholders to preserve and manage the entire collection. Partnering entities will develop a comprehensive, systematic plan of use, access, and sustainability for academic, artistic, and community constituencies."
