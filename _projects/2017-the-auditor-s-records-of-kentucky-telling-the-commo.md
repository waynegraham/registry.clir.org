summary: "The Kentucky State Archives proposes to digitize records from the Office of the Auditor of Public Accounts, also known as the Auditor’s Office. Over the course of 24 months, we will digitize 63 sets of bound volumes and loose documents, create appropriate metadata, and preserve and provide online public access to the digital surrogates using our digital preservation system Preservica. This collection documents the development of Kentucky government, infrastructure, and industry from 1792-1935, and will provide scholars and researchers with the opportunity to research topics such as river navigation, railroads, turnpikes, banks, corporations, distilled spirits, military papers, taxation, and land records. These records tell a comprehensive story of Kentucky’s history through reports made to the Auditor’s Office by state and local government agencies, institutions, and corporations."
