summary: "The hidden collections initiative will bring to light archival material that shows how Jewish individuals and organizations in the second half of the 20th century formed strong communities and organizations, engaged in social service, impacted scholarship and created art reflecting their experiences. In countries from the U.S. to Morocco to Romania, Jews encountered challenges associated with integration. They developed their cultural identities while maintaining commitments to the broader communities in which they lived. The project will include material from the American Jewish Historical Society and American Sephardi Federation."
