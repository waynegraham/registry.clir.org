summary: "Grove City College, a small liberal arts college located in northwestern Pennsylvania, owns an archive of 20,000 pages of unpublished works by Ludwig von Mises. Mises was a leading 20th century Austrian economist and the mentor of Dr. Hans Sennholz, a long-time Chair of the College's economics department. The historically significant collection covers Mises’ life in Europe during the rise of the Nazi party and the start of WWII to his emigration to the United States up until his death in 1973. Most of the papers cover his political and economic beliefs. The College’s archive team will digitize the collection and make it available via an online web portal located on www.gcc.edu. Scholars from around the world will be able to access the collection and the College will create linkages with other organizations to publicize the collection."
