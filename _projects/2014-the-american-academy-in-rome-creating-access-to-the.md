summary: "Over a period of 14 months, the American Academy in Rome will survey, preserve and catalog the \"American Academy in Rome\" archive of materials relating to the Academy's history, architecture, development, and community, including: digital and analog collections of photography, original Academy correspondence and documentation, books, and ephemera. While preservation and cataloging will make in-house use of the collections more user-friendly, the eventual result will be inclusion in and international access through the Academy's new online Digital Humanities Center, the deposit of original materials with the Archives of American Art, and discovery via major professional online directories such as ArchiveGrid."
