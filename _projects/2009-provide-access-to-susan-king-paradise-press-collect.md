summary: "Susan King moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s to be part of the experimental Feminist Studio Workshop. She eventually became the studio director of the Women's Graphic Center at the Woman's Building. She is the artist/author of numerous artists' books and scholarly writings about artists' books. Many of her works were published by Paradise Press which she founded. As a result, her collection documents several areas of study and transformative decades of the 1970s to 1990 in L.A. It is comprised of her writings, reviews, essays, articles, talks, sketches, and research material for workshops given and taken by Ms. King. Her writings also document Paradise Press including drafts, notes, research materials and published works; one linear foot box of photographs, negatives, contact sheets, and slides, along with photo-documentation of her trips to Europe; files on each of the Paradise Press projects including manuscripts, typescripts, correspondence, business records, typographical and binding design sketches, dummies and mock-ups, approx. 60 oversize art items; proof pages, and proof copies; one linear foot box containing unique books, finished projects, models and ideas for projects; several boxes of material pertaining to Ms. Kingâ€™s career in teaching and exhibiting including some student work and 40-50 structure models used for teaching and creating new work; 7 linear ft boxes of correspondence between Ms. King and other notable book artists, e.g. letters, postcards, emails."
