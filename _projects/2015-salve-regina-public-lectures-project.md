material_description:  "Public lectures at Salve Regina originate throughout several academic departments and units, the two most prominent being the lectures provided by the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy and the Atwood Lecture in the Humanities series. \n\n\n\nThe Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy was established by an act of Congress in 1996 to honor the life and work of Senator Claiborne Pell, encouraging international dialogue and developing citizenship at the local, national, and international levels. The center hosts 5-8 lectures per year in support of this mission.\n\n\n\nFounded by alumna Marjorie Atwood in 1982, the Atwood Lectures seek to bring prominent speakers and scholars to Salve Regina to present not only to the university, but the wider community. These lectures have always been free and supported predominantly by the Oliver S. and Jennie R. Donaldson Charitable Trust. One of Atwood's goals in founding this lecture series was to offer opportunities to experience thought-provoking presentations on current, critical issues."
