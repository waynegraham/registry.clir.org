summary: "The Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive contains the largest collection of political commercials in the world; more than 119,000 television and radio ads are found in our searchable online catalog. The radio dates to the late 1930's and the moving image dates to the 1950's. The Archive seeks to clean and transfer its 16mm color film collection for preservation. This grant would enable the archive to make this material accessible online through our website, YouTube channel and other social media outlets."
