summary: "Over the past 50 years the DFW Metroplex has experienced explosive growth. Collections included in this proposal relate to urban planning, politics, industry, industrial education and major infrastructure projects in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan area of North Texas. Topics included in these collections are especially relevant today--affordable housing, urban design, transportation (highway expansion, mass transit), crime, education and employment issues are central to these collections. The papers of Texas Representative Lanny Hall document his constituent's concerns during years of massive growth in Fort Worth and Arlington as well as political redistricting taking place on the state level (1979-1984). The planning and creation of DFW International Airport are well documented in the archive of Texas Metro magazine and in the papers of Dr. John T. Thompson (1966-1975). Also included in the Texas Metro magazine archive are approximately 20 linear feet of photographs. Collections reveal how implementation of the federal Model Cities program (1966-1974) and the Community Development Block Grant programs of the 1970â€™s affected North Texas. These files contain detailed documents and maps submitted by municipalities across four counties. Site proposals for the Superconducting Super Collider contain extensive documentation of the North Texas site chosen for the project in 1987."
