summary: "Our goal is to digitize, index, and make accessible six archival collections from the Arkansas/Oklahoma River Valley that document the voices of the minority groups that have helped shaped this frontier/border region of the United States. These other voices of the frontier are found in the Jack E. Hill Collection, the Judy Blevins Collections, The Lincoln Echo, the Dr. Harry McDonald Collection, the Southeast Asian Refugees at Fort Chaffee Collections, and the Bobby and Jerry Turner Collection. These collections represent African-American, Laotian, Hmong, Native American, and Vietnamese voices, which will help illuminate and enhance our collective understanding of US frontier history. Specifically, we seek to create open access digital copies of these repositories with a searchable index. This archive will function as a sampling of these border voices, helping scholars reconceive the predominantly white history of the frontier."
