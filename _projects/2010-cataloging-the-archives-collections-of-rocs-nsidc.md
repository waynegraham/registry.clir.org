summary: "These collections are a resource for people studying Earth's frozen regions, the history of science, or past climate related to the Earth's frozen regions. Included are materials from early expeditions to Alaska, the Alps, South and Central America, and Greenland. They also include thousands of maps, photographic prints, glass plate negatives, color slides, ice charts, and 38 cu ft of manuscript materials. These field notebooks and records contain not only scientific data but also personal accounts of daily life on the expedition, detailed sketches of glaciers and records of each photograph taken during the trip. Some examples include the field notebooks, manuscript collection, maps, and glass plate negatives and prints of Harry Fielding Reid (1859-1944), considered to be America's first geophysicist. Also included are the records of William S. Cooper (1884-1978), who chaired a committee of the Ecological Society of America, which was instrumental in the establishment of Glacier Bay National Monument (now a National Park); the field notebooks and photographs of Lawrence Martin (1880-1955), who spent time in the early 1900s on expeditions to Alaska and from 1924-1946 served as Chief of the Division of Maps at the Library of Congress; nearly 500 photographs donated by Bradford Washburn, pioneering mountain photographer and cartographer; Austin Post's 22-year photographic record of glaciers and glacier change in the northwestern United States is held on microfilm."
