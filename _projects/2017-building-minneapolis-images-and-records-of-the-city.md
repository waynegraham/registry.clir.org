material_description:  "The images to be digitized were created by staff from various departments of the City of Minneapolis over the course of the 20th century. These images record houses, buildings, streets, bridges, parks, gardens, various infrastructure elements, and community events in Minneapolis. The 1934 Housing Survey was conducted by WPA workers employed by the City of Minneapolis and records extensive detail on structural elements, demographics and living conditions for residential and commercial structures in Minneapolis."
