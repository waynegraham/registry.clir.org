summary: "The St. Louis Mercantile Library at the University of Missouri - St. Louis will digitize materials from the Waterways Journal Collection at the Herman T. Pott National Inland Waterways Library. The full collection comprises 219 linear feet of research documents accumulated by the editors of the Waterways Journal, the leading trade journal in the United States for inland waterway industries such as shipping and barge operators. The main achievement of this project will be digitizing the full run of the Waterways Journal from 1892 to today. Scanning will be done from original prints with microfilm backups for missing issues. From the larger research collection assembled by the editors of the journal over the past century, rare and related objects will be scanned as copyright allows."
