material_description:  "The Oklahoma Historical Society (OHS) will preserve and digitize 5000 audio files, for free public access, including: 1/4\" reel-to-reel magnetic tape; audio/mpeg; Cassette Tape, and CD-ROMs from the Living Legends Collection. The interviews selected will reflect the state's political, cultural, and economic history, span Oklahoma regionally and cover the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth century time period. The OHS believes that this undertaking will successfully contribute to the public's access to these regionally significant interviews as well as represent a number of national subjects, movements and individuals of note. The Living Legends Collection is the embodiment of first-hand history in the words of the men and women themselves. Students from grade school age through post-doctoral status will have a chance to listen to the tones, the inflections, the actual words spoken from the comfort of the class-room, home, office or personal computer. \n\nSample interviews of notable Oklahomans and notable National figures:\n\n\u0001Senator Phil Smalley - LL 131.A-B\n\n\u0001Senator Mike Monroney - LL 132.A-B (July 8, 1966), LL 392\n\n\u0001Senator Robert S.
