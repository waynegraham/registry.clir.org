summary: "Clemson University seeks to digitize the full collected papers of 8 former National Park Service (NPS) Directors housed in its Special Collections Library to coincide with the centennial of the NPS in 2016. George B. Hartzog, the seventh Director of the National Park Service, donated his papers to Clemson in 1984 and set the precedent for a collection focus on parks and protected areas at Clemson that has led to the acquisition of papers from all subsequent directors but two. These papers span nearly a century of our nation's history, documenting the evolution of this high profile leadership position and recording the local, national, and global impact of America's National Parks--an idea that has brought people together for a century and continues to interest scholars and the general public alike. Clemson expects this project will help define the next 100 years of the National Park Service."
